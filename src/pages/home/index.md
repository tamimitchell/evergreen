  blurb: >
    I'm a full time RVer with my pup Belle, chasing a full life and new adventures. I work as a web developer, and I love travel, hiking, technology, reading and music. I chose the name Evergreen because I feel like it really reflects who I am - I love exploring and learning, and I’ve found I’m happiest when I’m in an state of constant growth, and along the way I find awesome things that I want to share. And I love pine trees too!
