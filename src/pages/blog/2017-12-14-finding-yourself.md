> I’m no longer trying to ‘find myself’. I hope I never do. I want to always be changing. Always be evolving. Always be discovering. Always be doubting. Always be questioning. Always be improving. Never ‘finding’ myself..

From [Why I’m No Longer Interested in Finding Myself](https://findingmarshall.com/2017/12/03/not-interested-in-finding-myself/)

I love this!

I’m always curious about where I’ll be in life after a few years of living nomadically, and it’s fun to look around and see how nomads evolve in their lives. Some really get into exploring [the outdoors] (http://www.jenericramblings.com/2017/08/03/the-white-rim-trail-canyonlands-offroad-adventure/) in [different](http://www.themoreweexplore.com/mrb.html) [ways](http://www.watsonswander.com/2017/hiking-red-breaks-slot-canyon/), some move on to [other forms of travel](https://www.gonewiththewynns.com/sailing), [some](http://vespaandalaptop.com) double down on the [work that makes them happy](https://ultimatewphelp.com), some [help people build their own life of freedom on the road](https://rvtofreedom.com) and [others](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZuXzqmlx_M) find the perfect place to [settle down](https://www.instagram.com/p/BadHEroF8_Z).

What stands out to me is that while there are nomads living in very different ways, there are certain traits that come from a life of travel. They’ve spent enough time under the stars, and seen enough miles and amazing sights to understand how small we are compared to the world. Living on the move and in tiny ‘homes’ have emphasized what really matters in life. Experiences and relationships are prioritized over physical objects, and the objects that are kept are the ones that are truly loved or needed. They’ve experienced and lived through the failures, fears and doubt that holds other people back from living a life of travel, and are more confident for it. They’ve rejected what society says you must have to be successful and stable, and focus instead on what makes a good life for themselves personally. Once you do this the first time, it’s even easier to [evolve your life into something new](/blog/rebooting-life) that fits you better and allows for more growth.

There are certainly plenty of people who have these traits without trading their houses and most possessions to live in a tiny nomadic home, but I’ve found that most nomads I’ve met share these characteristics. They’re much happier for it because they’re less afraid to do and share what they really love, and they’ve given themselves the freedom to live the way that suits them best. No matter form it takes, and even though it will evolve over time.
