## The new RV is finally mine!

I couldn’t believe it was actually happening when I pulled out of the RV dealer’s lot.

It was only about a month after I’d decided to get my own RV and restart my nomad life, but it felt like it took absolutely forever. All I wanted to do was get going on life, but so many little roadblocks kept popping up. So many drives into Salt Lake to tour RVs and pick one, then again and again to make sure the one I signed away on was actually new and actually had no issues. No really, I’ll wait a few more weeks to get a model that doesn’t have cracks in the roof.

But now my rig was finally ready! My family and I had gone over every inch of it, the dealer had installed the solar system, and I went through all the paperwork. They handed me the keys, and I slid into the driver’s seat.

Now to get it back to my Mom’s in one piece. Through Salt Lake City, in rush hour traffic! Aside from a test drive around the dealership, this was my first time driving it for real. I knew how to drive big trucks, and my motorhome is one of the shortest you can get, but I was pretty out of practice with driving and it felt absolutely humongous. Even thought the cab is like a regular truck, and the nose is even shorter, the RV box is much wider than anything I’d driven before. You can’t use the center rear view mirror, but the side mirrors are big and the backup camera doubles as a rear view, even going down the road. My stepmom Evelyn was super sweet, she had driven me into town, spent the long day with me at the dealership finalizing everything, and drove home slow enough for me to follow her in the RV on the way back. I wanted to take all the back roads we could. The highway was already filling up with traffic and I was so nervous about driving the rig at all! We did have to get on I-15 for a little while, and I am not proud of my first freeway merge. I’m pretty sure the passenger truck behind me thought I was going way too slow to ever merge into traffic. He romped on the gas and dove around me as soon as we got on the freeway. Really, dude? Isn’t it super obvious a silly girl with wild nomad dreams is attempting (badly) to drive a huge beast on the freeway? Can’t you just go easy on me today? My hands were sweating and I was shaking, but I got her up to 65 and really, things were going fine.

We made it onto the back roads, which suddenly felt crazy tight and bumpy, and I didn’t actually know where I was going. I probably should have just stayed on the freeway, but oh well, we were on our way. My motorhome rides really pretty quiet, but every bump that that rattled something inside or made her bounce made me clench the steering wheel hard. Did we forget I lock something down? Maybe they sold me a rig with bad suspension and it was going to come apart any minute now. (I don’t really know much about vehicles, maybe this is a thing that can happen?) Every tree overhanging the road looked way too short. Was I going to survive this first drive home without ripping off my roof or smashing into something because I didn’t take a corner the right way? All I could do was breathe, and keep driving. We made it onto 1-80 west (this time I merged without issue) and took the last stretch home to Tooele. At least I knew these roads. The anxiety let up and I had flashes of ‘hooray, it’s finally mine!’ and ‘dang, listen to that engine’ and ‘woah, I’ve never had a new car but now I own a brand new dually truck’.

I pulled into Mom’s drive and hugged goodbye and thanks to Evelyn. With lots of help from Mom, I took my time backing it slowly in. Then I got out and let myself relax. We made it! She did just fine, handled the roads smoother and easier than I expected, and now she was all mine and ready to be home for Belle and I!

## Turning her into a home

It didn’t take Belle long to realize this was home now - she found her seat, her doggy bed, and proceeded to take over the big bed.

It didn’t take me long to make it into a home, either. While I was waiting for the RV to be ready, I’d been browsing Amazon and hitting up Wal-Mart (because this is what you do for fun in Tooele if you don’t have a dirt bike) so I had a big pile of everything I needed to be stocked up for the road. I spent the first night moving it all in and organizing everything, then relaxing on our new bed and thinking of a name for the rig.

## Giving her a name

I wanted it to have a name. We were going to be travel companions for a long time, and I really feel like it makes a difference to give something physical that matters to me a name. It kind of gives a thing a personality, and makes me feel like I have a stronger relationship to it. The RV already felt like a ‘her’, like a momma bear. I wanted her to take us to beautiful mountains, protect Belle and I, and be strong and brave when I wasn’t. And I’m a geek ... I’d been reading a lot of Greek and Roman history and mythology.

So, I named her Artemis, after the Greek goddess of the hunt, archery, wild animals, wilderness, and the moon. I feel like it’s perfect!
