As I write this post, six months have gone by since I rebooted my life. It’s already been an amazing adventure! My intention with this blog is to document my experiences so that I can appreciate and remember them, but I also feel like it’s a story worth sharing with other people, and on more than just a surface level.

### Why I’m writing this blog
This might come across as cheesy, but I’m attempting to build a truly full life and become the best version of myself I can be. I want to share this journey with the people I love, anyone who wants to know me better, and maybe inspire like-minded people to build their own best version of life. I’ll warn you right here, I’m writing this blog so I can share whole experiences: travel stories yes, but also the thoughts and feelings that come along, and awesome things I find along the way from a wide variety of topics. This goes against all advice about writing a blog I’ve ever read (you should pick a subject and focus on it!) - but you know what, I enjoy being someone who has a wide range of interests, and I really want to have at a place where I can share it all. I’m a whole person and my experiences are absolutely colored by the context of what else is going on in my life at any given time, and I feel like that adds to the story.  But I’ll make it easy for you to filter these posts and take in/ignore what you want. Another warning, I’m out of practice with writing or even sharing what I feel, and it’s probably going to be super cheesy at times and very much supplemented by other voices that say what I feel better than I can. So hey, if this blog is all a bit too messy/detailed/emotional/geeky/whatever, I’m sure you’ll find better things to do with your time and my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/tami_evergreen/) is a much more lightweight way to follow me if you’d still like to.

### Prologue; or How Someday turned into Today

For pretty much most of my life, I’ve lived in a state of ‘someday’. Someday I’ll have a horse, someday I’ll travel to cool places, someday I’ll build something awesome. Someday I’ll be happy. Over the past few years, I settled into a pretty comfortable life, the sort that looks nice from the outside and is just easy enough to not want to change. I had a long-term relationship, the start of a decent programming career, a big house in Logan, UT. I set myself on a particular course and willingly gave up control of life in exchange for comfort. It’s not like I was all that good at running my own life anyway, and aren’t things like having a house and being willing to compromise what being adult is all about?

But more and more I felt like I could only be myself in little snippets of time; hiking on my own in the mountains, rare moments of creative flow, learning from like-minded people on the internet, and a lot of escaping into books and video games and music and TV that inspired me to be better. Someday.

Someday I’ll live life my way - I’ll finally leave Utah which never felt like home to me, take the necessary time to work on my mind and body, cut my hair as short as I want to, color it something crazy, get a few tattoos. Create a home for myself living on the road, work from forests, explore amazing cities. Make some friends that want to live life on my level.  Find a way to manage bouts of seasonal depression better. Really grow my career, actually be a part of the programming conferences I’ve dreamed about going to, create something worthwhile and helpful to people. See all the wonderful places in the world I’ve always wanted to go and don’t know much about yet; Oregon, Montana, Texas, Ireland, Greece, Australia. Everywhere. Hike it all, eat all the amazing food I can, dive deep into other cultures and learn what makes life worth living to other people. Figure out what else makes a full, rich, meaningful life, and live like that. Experience everything I possibly can; life is only a tiny slice of time and I’m beginning to believe we have a moral obligation to make the most out of it and help others as much as possible while we’re still breathing.

But yeah, Someday. For the meantime I barely had the energy to ride along on the course I chose a long time ago. I thought of all this ‘someday’ as my backup plan in case my comfortable life fell apart, and never really shared it, but looking back now I know it was what I actually wanted out of life. I was slowly realizing it was only going to happen, my way, if I did it on my own. And of course dwelling on these plans pushed an already shaky at times relationship farther apart.

We were making small steps together toward where I wanted to be; we got some mountain property in Lava Hot Springs, a fifth wheel that felt more like home than anything before, and lived in it on the road full time for a winter. It was an amazing eye opening experience. We ‘lived’ in beautiful mountains, serene lakesides, family’s backyards, and warm deserts. It was so close to being free! At the same time being in such a small space together all the time only amplified existing issues. That taste of freedom made me realize the nomad life was not only realistic but felt so much like living true to myself.  I wanted to live it fully, in a personally healthy, truly engaged way with room to be myself.  Escapism and holding out for tiny moments of feeling free wasn’t enough any more when I was so close to how I really wanted to live.

At a certain point, all I could see in the future on the current course was buckling down for an mental and emotional winter compared to the glimpse of light and freedom I’d seen.

I wasn’t strong enough to break old habits, change the course, alter it enough to make it work. So I decided to make Someday into Today, hit the reset button and jumped off the course I’d followed passively for way too long.

### The Reboot

My current journey grew out of the ashes of my old life.  Within a fairly short amount of time I went from having a very passive, easy, lonely life in the suburbs with a dying relationship, to living as a solo nomad with a growing soul, wonderful friends, and a renewed love for life. It’s hard to write about my past life since it was such a mix of good and bad, but I’m using this writing as part of my healing process, and I feel like it gives a lot of context on where I came from. Maybe it can give hope to others who dream about a better life than what they live now.

I still have a long list of Somedays, but I’m slowly turning them into reality. I colored my hair superhero blue and chopped it short. I took up hiking, yoga, and meditation more seriously than ever before and felt it all reshape my mind and body. I bought an RV and made it into a home base for me and my dog. Then I took off to explore places I’d never been in Utah, Idaho, Oregon and California. I’ve left pieces of my heart in all of these places already, but it’s only growing to take in more. I spent a lot of wonderful, meaningful time with family who gave me much needed support and love. I found amazing, loving, accepting friends, many who understand and live the nomad life on various levels. I’m finding that I’m not quite the person I thought I would be, but much more social, light hearted and content, and I’m learning to take the feeling of home with me anywhere I go. I’ve hit levels of happiness, freedom, and being truly present in life that I never knew existed before. I’m still working through a lot of pain, brokenness, and bad habits, but I won’t ever give up on growing toward the best version of myself.

My life isn’t perfect and never will be, but now it’s growing into something amazing and truly worth living. I truly hope that by sharing this journey with you, you’ll find something that makes your life grow as well!
