Belle and I spent our first few days in Artemis just parked my Mom’s driveway. I was getting used to it, testing out the solar to see if it could support full work days (it could, just fine), and sorting out a few other things so I could to be ready to get back on the road (like getting my hair cut short, yay!). It was really getting hot in town and I was really excited to get back to full RV nomad life, but I’ve heard plenty of people recommend taking a new RV on a short ‘shakedown’ trip before going very far. There’s usually a few things that go wrong or that you realize you need to get. I planned on making a few ‘baby step’ trips before I really left my home base and got too far out of range of my supportive family.

So my first baby step was the campground up Settlement Canyon - a whole 3 miles from my Mom’s place! I mostly wanted to make sure this RV wasn’t going to have problems with typical campground hookups, and Settlement’s campground has shade to escape the heat and a few nice hiking trails including [my favorite hike in Tooele County](/blog/2017-06-11-hiking-in-settlement-canyon/).

Driving over was still a little intimidating on the canyon road. I was worried about taking corners the right way, not dropping the rear dually tires off the side of the road, and overhanging trees, but it was starting to be more comfortable. I backed her into my spot a few times for practice, then adjusted away from the power point to make room for the slide (oh, turns out there’s plenty!). I was used to RV life but I wasn’t used to leveling a motorhome, and since Artemis doesn’t have jacks, that means driving onto blocks stacked to the correct height for each tire so the whole rig is flat and level. In my case this process was: drive up on a block, check the cheap bubble level I put on the floor, drive off the block, put more down, drive up on the blocks, rinse and repeat until the bubble level looks good. It took a little while, but I got it figured out, put the slide out, and plugged in to power and water. And everything worked fine. The AC started up when I turned it on, and the water pressure was just right.

All of these things were little worries at first, but I’d done my research, had the right parts, and took everything slow. As I worked my way through each worry and everything went smooth, I started feeling a rush of freedom. Sure, everything took a little bit to get used to, but I could take my time, breathe, and work through it my own way. It was one thing to dream about doing all this on my own, but to actually be out driving and parking my very own nomad home under shady maples in a beautiful canyon felt amazing.

We spent a few days in Settlement, working under the awning and trees, hiking during the evenings, and listening to the crickets at night. Belle picked up on the new rhythm really fast. She had figured out her spots; on her bed by the center console while we were driving, sitting in the driver’s seat watching for birds in the morning, hanging out on the leash by my chair during the day, and sprawled in the center of bed at night. I made dinner for my Mom and brother Luke and his little family one night. It was nice to have a few days alone, but it was just as fun to spend relaxed time around my family too.

I got to spend so much quality time with my family while I was working through the whole ‘[resetting life]’ thing and getting the new RV. I only lived a couple hours from them for the past years, but I mostly only came down to see them during family events and holidays. More and more though, I’m finding I love the little casual moments with my family the most, and I needed a lot more of that in my life. Cooking dinner together, playing peekaboo with my one-year-old nephew, hanging out in the garage, catching up on the important things in their life and the little things too. It was really satisfying, and so healing for my soul.

So, my brother Jake was having a birthday campout party up Middle Canyon (another canyon in Tooele where you can escape the desert heat), and even though I was worried about driving up that road, I figured hanging out with him would be worth the challenge. Middle is longer and much tighter and winding than Settlement (look, let’s be honest, Settlement Canyon is a piece of cake). I had to swerve around a lot of overhanging trees and I went really slow, but it was a chance get a feel for where my rear tires rode. When I got up to camp, it felt like I took a whole hour figuring out where to park and leveling Artemis. Jake offered help but didn’t step in and take over, he just let me work through it myself. It’s so incredibly freeing to be around people who have enough confidence in me to trust that I can do things on my own. I found out I needed more blocks to handle parking on really uneven ground, but I got it level enough, set up for the night, walked over for a beer and let myself quit stressing about it being absolutely level.

I had such a good time that night hanging out with family and friends! It didn’t feel weird to be one of the few single people there (something else I was worried about), I really just felt like I could be myself more than ever. My home was there, I knew I could take it up winding forest roads now, and I was around awesome people who love and believe in me. Another challenge tackled and turned into a feeling of freedom, more awesome relaxed time with loved ones, and a beautiful hike with Belle the next morning. This was already worth all the work and waiting, and we were just getting started!
