My next baby step/shake down trip was a family trip to go see my grandparents in Wyoming for the 4th of July. I took off a few days early and made a few stops along the way to break the trip up a bit.

My first stop was Rockport State Park. I got up at 5 am (which, if you know me, happens very rarely) and headed out. This time the freeway seemed much less stressful! There was a lot less traffic, but no with trees to dodge compared to my last trip, I was feeling pretty good about things. Plus I’d made a new music playlist with [country songs about driving](https://open.spotify.com/user/tm48/playlist/66saFdS40RoqXVaOZ55Tpn?si=gJytT15DSyyIBPszqnN2JQ) and getting out of town, and I had that cranked up. Turnpike Troubadours, Sturgill Simpson, Randy Rogers and Miranda Lambert make everything better. Look, if you hang around me for any decent amount of time you’ll probably be subjected to this playlist. Sorry ... not sorry. Anyway, Artemis’s speakers were working great and so was the engine. She made it up Parley’s Summit, a long steep mountain pass, without breaking a sweat. In fact, I was only going 55 just to go easy on her, but another Coachmen motorhome exactly like mine passed me going at least 65. That was a little embarrassing actually, but oh well, I was still getting used to driving mine!

Rockport State Park is just a little ways off 1-80, and it has a [few campgrounds](https://www.campendium.com/rockport-state-park) both with and without hookups. I went for a non-hookup site in the Twin Coves campground. It’s really a nice campground but my site was pretty unlevel - yet again, I needed more blocks. I made it as level as I could, but as I worked throughout the day, I kept worrying about that. It’s hard on RV fridges to be unlevel for very long, but there wasn’t a whole lot I could do.

I finally wrapped up work and made myself stop worrying about being level, and took Belle for what turned out to be a wonderful hike and some play time in the beautiful reservoir! We followed a hiking trail from the campground up to the docks. It happens to have a 3d archery range which looks very fun. I plan on getting into archery someday, it seems like a lot of fun and a good nomad hobby. And at this point it almost seems inevitable that I’ll become the real life version of my old hobby - a World of Warcraft night elf hunter, complete with a pet ‘wolf’, blue hair, and a growing list of unfinished quests, exploring all the parts of the map I haven’t seen before. Meanwhile, I have a lot of things to get for the RV. Like more leveling blocks.

Other than a nice lady at a cute little convenience store on the docks, I hardly saw any people. The peace and quiet, sunshine, and cool water, were totally relaxing. I almost couldn’t believe how nice everything felt. I’ll certainly be back to Rockport, it seems like a great place to spend a summer weekend!

After Rockport, we headed up to stay on [BLM land by the Green River](https://www.campendium.com/slate-creek-wyoming) in Wyoming. After driving through southern Wyoming’s desert, it was really nice to pull into a green little stretch of land near the river. I got lucky and pulled into an easy open spot early in the day, but with it near the 4th of July weekend, most of the other spots around filled up pretty fast with big family groups. There was plenty of room between us all, though. Belle and I hung out in Artemis for the workday because the mosquitos were really horrible! But later in the evening we went for a walk along the river, and saw a few  fish jumping and mule deer grazing off in the distance.
