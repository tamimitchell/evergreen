I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with Utah. People who don’t live here light up when they hear the word ‘Utah’ - I’m pretty sure they’re thinking of majestic national parks, idealistic ski resorts, and maybe Moab or the Uintas. I tend to think of sagebrush deserts, a lack of community for people who aren’t of a particular religion, and months of dealing with bitter cold, inversion, and huge drifts of dirty snow covering town streets. Mostly it’s a general feeling of being trapped in places and circumstances I don’t want to be in. But that all stems from my past. The reality is that I’m not actually trapped here, my family who I love dearly live here, and there really is a lot of beautiful nature to explore. Hiking in Settlement Canyon today really clarified these feelings for me.

In all of Tooele County, my very favorite place is Settlement Canyon - and Left Hand Fork trail in particular. This county is made up of a lot of dry desert split by a few mountain ranges where you can find junipers or pines if you go high enough.

But Settlement Canyon is green! There are maples, pines, grass and flowers! During a few months in spring, a little creek runs down to Settlement Reservoir from the mountains and makes all the difference.

And if you take Left Hand Fork trail for a few miles, you’ll find aspen trees! After climbing out of a hot desert, this feels like absolute heaven for a forest lover like me. It’s the only place I know where initials carved in trees adds to the experience.

In high school, I used to escape up to Settlement as much as I possibly could. The first time I came up here was riding horses with my Dad. I still remember following him around a corner and seeing the beautiful stands of aspens for the first time. My horse was warm under me, the air was cool, and the contrast of white against so much green took my breath away. This trail is where I learned to deal with my fear of heights, how to race horses at full speed through trees you have to duck below and around, and how to be project calm if they start panicking and things feel terrifying. (Also to not take rodeo horses up steep Utah hills that make them panic.)

I came back on horses, bikes, and foot, and it never failed to refresh my soul after dealing with my parent’s divorce, depression, and everything that comes with being a high school kid. One weekend before I could even drive I took a couple of our horses way back into the hills and spent the night under the stars, alone. It was heavenly.

Back in the present day, I was a crazy mix of feelings. Free and strong, excited about the plans I was making but terrified I’d fail at them, lighter than I’d felt in a long time, and anxious to move on with my new life already. I was living at my Mom’s house, waiting for my new motorhome to be ready to take home, but it was taking so much longer than I anticipated. So in the meantime I hiked as much as I could, and on this day Mom and Belle I went up to Settlement. She’d never seen this section Left Hand Fork before, and I hoped she’d love it as much as I did.

She did - I remember we hit a certain point of the trail and both teared up a bit. The only thing more magical than finding a place you love is sharing it with someone who gets it just as deeply.

Hiking up this trail after so many years of being away from it brought back so many memories of who I was in high school. Worried about college, what I’d do with my life, how I was going to find the ‘perfect guy’ to make life whole. I just wanted to go back tell myself it'll be alright, enjoy the good things in life where you’re at, follow what makes your heart grow, and just stay free. I wonder, what would my future self tell me now? Maybe the same things.

This section is where you break out of the the aspens and pines into this cute little meadow. On a horse, this is where you lean forward and push into a gallop!

The best part of Left Hand Fork isn’t actually the aspens, though. It’s when you climb up a hill and suddenly there’s this incredibly green hidden canyon, and it feels like maybe you’re the only one who’s ever seen it.

Look at all that green. Is this what Oregon or New Zealand is like? I have to know.
